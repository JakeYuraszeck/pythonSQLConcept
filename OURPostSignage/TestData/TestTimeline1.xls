The City of Joliet Ordinance requires that grass cannot be over 8 inches tall.  This property  including the parkway along Black Rd. is in violation and has received several complaints.   At this point, I am placing the property on the contractor cut list.   Meaning, Friday, August 26.   City contractors will place bids to receive a mowing/clean up contract for properties in the Joliet area which have been designated in violation and have not abated the issue.   If you are the service provider for 712 Westshire and have the grass cut before the bids go out on Friday, then the lawn  will be considered in compliance.  If not, the City will send a contractor, bill the owner and place the owner/property in hearing which will entail court cost and fines.  I have also left a voicemail for you on the contact number you provided in the email.   Feel free to call or text my 	Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC	Loancare	2023-02-22 11:04:49	2
